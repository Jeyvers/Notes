What is Design??

- The best way to produce a design that solves your users' problem is by first understanding the problem.
- Ask questions. As a designer, you must ask why? (Who are we designing for? What are the problems that they face? How can we go about solving those problems? Why might our solution not work? What can we do about that? Why was a decision made by our team or company)
- <blockquote> Steve Jobs said, "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like, people think it's this veneerâ€”that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." </blockquote>
